What is SQLAlchemy and why do we need it?

SQLAlchemy is an SQL toolkit and ORM system for Python, providing a way to communicate with databases that is abstracted away from the underlying SQL. It makes managing relationships between data easier and provides a more Pythonic way to interact with databases.

What is Flask-SQLAlchemy?

Flask-SQLAlchemy is a Flask extension that integrates SQLAlchemy into Flask applications. It simplifies the use of SQLAlchemy by providing useful defaults and helpers.

How is SQLAlchemy different from raw SQL?

SQLAlchemy provides a high-level, Pythonic interface to SQL databases, as opposed to writing raw SQL queries. This allows developers to benefit from the abstraction of Python classes while still having the full power and flexibility of SQL if needed.

What is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)?

ORM is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. SQLAlchemy is an example of an ORM system, which maps Python classes to tables in SQL databases.

What is a session in SQLAlchemy?

A session in SQLAlchemy manages all transactions with the database. A session holds all the objects loaded or associated with it for its lifespan, and provides the entry point to communicate with the database.

What are CRUD operations?

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete - these are the basic operations performed on any database.

Important Things to Know about Flask-SQLAlchemy:

Models in SQLAlchemy: Understanding models, which are Python classes that are tied to real SQL tables, is fundamental. These models form the structure of the database.

CRUD Operations: Students should know how to perform the basic CRUD operations, which are the cornerstone of all database work.

Understanding Sessions: In SQLAlchemy, a session is a workspace for your objects, similar to a transaction in SQL. Knowing how to work with sessions is key.

Database Relationships: Understanding how to set up and manage relationships between different models is crucial, such as one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.

Queries: SQLAlchemy provides a rich and varied syntax for querying your database. Understanding how to write these queries is important.

Flask-SQLAlchemy Configuration: Flask-SQLAlchemy provides several configuration values; understanding them can help fine-tune an application's database connection.

Data Types: SQLAlchemy supports a wide array of SQL data types, and even some database-agnostic and vendor-specific types.

Schema Migration: As your application evolves, so too will your database schema. Tools like Alembic (from the authors of SQLAlchemy) can assist in managing these migrations.

Performance: Knowing when to use things like lazy='dynamic', when to batch operations, and when to commit the session can have big impacts on performance.

Security: Understanding how to avoid common security pitfalls, such as SQL injection attacks, is critical. SQLAlchemy's ORM does a great job at protecting you, but it's important to know the potential risks.
