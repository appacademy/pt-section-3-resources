### Thursday Redux State Shape && Front End Routes

#### Redux State Shape

- This is optional but can be extremely helpful to get your team on the same page of how your redux store for your application will look
- While creating this state shape, the idea is to map out every subscription that you will have
- [Redux Shape Example](example_project_docs/redux_shape.md)

#### Front End Routes

- This is also optional but can be helpful to help your team planout what you react router will look like for your frontend, and also let users know where your frontend routes will lead to.
